### yetanother_raycaster_pygame.py 2.0

This is a much more elaborate version (in Python 2.7/Pygame) of the raycaster tutorial script described in the parent directory. This version (2.0) features:

- Larger mazes with scrolling viewport (cool!),
- Collision detection with sound,
- Random generated mazes,
- Optional (simple) shading.

Maze generation code by [exciteabletom](https://github.com/exciteabletom/mazegenerator).

Few (but relevant) lines of shading code by [Stanislav Petrov](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/Raycasting-3d-game-tutorial).

Sound "wallhit.wav" created by me with a software synthesizer (called ZynAddSubFx).

A much earlier version "1.1" containing a more literal translation of the tutorial code is kept in the according directory. It is not needed to run version 2.0.

License is the MIT license as described in the directory above.
