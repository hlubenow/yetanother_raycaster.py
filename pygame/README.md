### yetanother_raycaster_pygame.py 2.0

This is a much more elaborate version (in Python 2.7/Pygame) of the raycaster tutorial script described in the parent directory. This version (2.0) features:

- Larger mazes with scrolling viewport (cool!),
- Collision detection with sound,
- Random generated mazes,
- Optio to set the size of the generated maze,
- Optional (simple) wall shading,
- Optional joystick support (1 joystick),
- Option to not show the rays.

The options can be set in variables in upper case at the beginning of the script, like for example `SHADING = True`.

Main ray casting algorithm by [3DSage](https://github.com/3DSage/OpenGL-Raycaster_v1).

Random maze generation code by [exciteabletom](https://github.com/exciteabletom/mazegenerator).

Few (but relevant) lines of wall shading code by [Stanislav Petrov](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/Raycasting-3d-game-tutorial).

Sound "wallhit.wav" created by me with a software synthesizer (called ZynAddSubFx).

A much earlier version "1.1" containing a more literal translation of the tutorial code is kept in the according directory. It is not needed to run version 2.0.

License is the MIT license as described in the directory above.

@3DSage I'm going to the beach now. (Wish, I could ...)

@exciteabletom Thanks for the maze generator.
