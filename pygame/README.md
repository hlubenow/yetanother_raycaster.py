### yetanother_raycaster_pygame.py 2.0

This is a much more elaborate version (in Python 2.7/Pygame) of the raycaster tutorial script described in the parent directory. This version features:

- Larger mazes with scrolling viewport (cool!),
- Collision detection with sound,
- Random generated mazes,
- Optional (simple) shading.

Maze generation code by [https://github.com/exciteabletom/mazegenerator](exciteabletom).
Few (but relevant) lines of shading code by [https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/Raycasting-3d-game-tutorial](Stanislav Petrov).
